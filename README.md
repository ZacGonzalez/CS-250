# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

# User needs first discussed among this software developer team as well as the client. They have multiple number of discussions as to what who and how the software should look like and what its requirements are. The user requirements discuss the various unambiguously by writing it and documenting it to determine a perfect project path. User requirements are noted in well formatted manner in a form of to-do list. Document known as software requirement specification is used for this purpose. It includes feasibility study, requirement gathering, software requirement specification document as well as validation for the requirements. Thereafter the requirements are prioritised based on their importance. Thereafter, some conflicts are resolved and negotiations take place on features and prices. Rafter that basic skeleton of the software is developed with minimal features and United 82 step after verification from customer there other features added based on priorities.


# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

# In order to start developing a program or software, developer should have a clear picture of what features it must include and what should be avoided. There must be a process of unambiguous requirement gathering before any kind of software development process begins. After getting the requirements from the client the developer should decide software development model is best suited for the software to develop. These models include iterative, waterfall, prototype or agile model and others.
